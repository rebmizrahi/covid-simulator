Comprehensive Examination

For my final term project and comprehensive examination I made a covid simulator. Balls represent people and move in random directions at different speeds. If a susceptible ball touches an infected ball, it too becomes infected. After a certain amount of time the infected recovers and can no longer spread the virus (assumed immunity).
There is also a game version where you control a susceptible ball in the simulation. Move with the mouse and try to avoid getting infected for as long as possible.
